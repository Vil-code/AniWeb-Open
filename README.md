# AniWeb
Link to heroku page
https://mysterious-citadel-24361.herokuapp.com/ This is my Fullstack project. It features 
a site, where you can post animation titles and news regarding them. You can also comment on 
those posts, and view your posts, likes and comments from your own profile. Note that most of the 
functionality of the site is locked away unless you have signed up (only username and password 
needed) and logged in afterwards. You also have a profile picture, which you can change from the 
profile page

# Important
The information on anime are taken from https://anilist.co/search/anime/top-100 and the news from: https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/.
